				<h5>Additional Resource</h5>
				<p>The website of the National Council on Aging features interactive training modules on several topics related to evidence-based programming. Series 1: Intro to Health Promotion Programs contains two modules that provide in-depth information on EBPs: <a href="http://www.ncoa.org/improve-health/center-for-healthy-aging/online-training-modules/series-1-intro-to-health.html">http://www.ncoa.org/improve-health/center-for-healthy-aging/online-training-modules/series-1-intro-to-health.html</a>.<br />
				The first module (Introduction: What Do We Mean By Evidence-Based?) of the Using What Works: Adapting Evidence-Based Programs to Fit Your Needs series of the National Cancer Institute provides details on the significance of EBPs: <a href="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/use_what_works/mod1/start.htm">http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/use_what_works/mod1/start.htm</a>.</p>

			<div class="small-9 columns doc-right">
				<p>The first step in selecting an EBP is to identify the needs of your audience. Knowing the needs of your audience will enable you to select an intervention that is relevant and has the potential to make a positive impact. “Needs” can be defined simply as the difference between present conditions and more desirable conditions. Needs are generally classified into two categories: actual (or true) and perceived (or reported). Actual needs can be objectively identified and are substantiated or demonstrated by measurements, such as death or disease rates. Perceived needs are reported by audience members as they draw from their experiences, ideas, feelings, and instincts.</p>
				<p>Actual and perceived needs are not mutually exclusive. Often times the two will overlap because audience members will perceive needs that are substantiated by objective data. It would take enormous amounts of time and energy to classify all of an audience’s needs as perceived, actual, or both. A more efficient approach is to identify as many needs as possible and then determine which of these can be addressed through your organization’s programming. </p>
				<p>Needs can be identified through primary and secondary sources of data. These data types are explained in the subsequent sections. Though it is ideal to gather data from numerous sources, your organization may not have the resources to use all of the sources that are provided as examples. Do not let this discourage you from assessing your audience’s needs. Simply select the sources that are realistic given your organization’s resources. If at all possible, use at least one primary and one secondary source. For information on what to do with needs assessment data once it is collected, see the content on Prioritizing Needs.  </p>

				<h2>Delphi Technique</h2>
				<p>The Delphi technique is a form of multi-step survey where the administrators contact participants more than once. Generally, participants are contacted via mail or email with one or two broad questions. The responses to these questions are analyzed and a second questionnaire, with more specific questions, is returned to participants. Several iterations or cycles of this process (usually five or fewer) will occur until consensus is reached. The Delphi technique is often used with groups of experts on a given topic. During a needs assessment, key informants (individuals with the knowledge and ability to report the needs of the audience) serve as experts. Additional details on the Delphi method, including sample invitation letters, are available on a tip sheet developed by the University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension: <a href="http://www.uwex.edu/ces/pdande/resources/pdf/Tipsheet4.pdf.">http://www.uwex.edu/ces/pdande/resources/pdf/Tipsheet4.pdf.</a></p>
				<h2>Observation</h2>
				<p>Members of the audience and the environment surrounding them can be observed as part of a needs assessment. For example, needs assessors may stand on a street corner and observe drivers to determine how many are wearing seatbelts. Additional behaviors and environmental conditions that can be observed include the use of hard hats by workers in a construction site, cigarette smoking by employees during work breaks, or vegetable consumption by individuals in a cafeteria. A popular form of observation is a windshield survey or walking tour, during which assessors drive and/or walk through a designated area, viewing as much of it as possible. While moving through the area, they watch for various predetermined elements (e.g., public transportation availability, housing type and quality, existence and quality of parks). The assessors document notes about what they see, hear, and smell regarding the elements. The notes are later analyzed for themes. A brief guide to windshield surveys is available from The Community Tool Box of the University of Kansas: <a href="http://ctb.ku.edu/en/tablecontents/chapter3-section21-main.aspx. ">http://ctb.ku.edu/en/tablecontents/chapter3-section21-main.aspx. </a> </p>

				<h2>Sources of Secondary Data</h2>
				<p>Secondary data are data that have already been collected by someone else. Secondary data are advantageous because they are often available for immediate use and are inexpensive, if not free, to use. However, because secondary data were collected previously, it is difficult to determine if the data are still applicable to the audience or if appropriate methodologies were used during data collection. These are significant disadvantages. Obtaining secondary data from reputable sources, several of which are identified below, can help you capitalize on the advantages of secondary data and guard against the disadvantages.</p>

						<h1>Toolkit Glossary</h1>
						<p id="got-info">scroll to see all</p>
						<div class="glossary">
							<div class="glossary-left">
								<p><em>Adaptation</em>– Making changes to an evidence-based program in order to make it more suitable for a particular organization and/or audience.</p>
								<p><em>Baseline</em> – A starting point. In evidence-based programming, the term “baseline” is usually used in the context of data collection, where baseline data is data collected before a program is implemented.</p>
								<p><em>Credentials</em> – A testimony of qualification, competence, or authority issued to an individual by a third party. Examples of credentials include academic diplomas, academic degrees (e.g., MSW, MPH, PhD), licenses (e.g., MD, RN, LCSW), certifications (e.g., CHES, CPR, first aid), and security clearances.</p>
								<p><em>Evidence </em>– Facts or testimony in support of a conclusion, statement, or belief. In some settings, individuals may refer to “levels of evidence” or “types of evidence.” These terms will have specific definitions unique to the setting in which they are used. When referring to evidence-based programs, the term “evidence” is generally used to describe the findings or results of program evaluation studies.</p>
								<p><em>Evidence-based program</em> – A program that has been thoroughly evaluated by researchers who determined it produces positive outcomes.</p>
								<p><em>Fidelity</em> – The extent to which a program is being implemented as its developers intended for it to be.</p>
								<p><em>Implementation</em> – Putting into action or carrying out a program.</p>
								<p><em>Instrument</em> – A measurement tool. Instruments can take many forms including biomedical equipment (e.g., glucometer, blood pressure monitor, weight scale), pencil and paper tests, questionnaires, and interviews. A thermometer is an instrument used to measure body temperature. Likewise, a survey is an instrument that can be used to measure anxiety.</p>
								<p><em>Medicaid</em> – A publically-funded health insurance program for individuals who have low incomes and fall into certain categories of eligibility.</p>
								<p><em>Objectives</em> – Specific, measurable steps that can be taken to achieve goals.</p>
								<p><em>Peer review</em> – When experts review a professional’s performance, research, or writings. Peer review is a way that qualified professionals self-regulate their professions. Performance, research, or writings that pass the peer review process have increased credibility or trustworthiness.</p>
								<p><em>Program champion</em> – An individual who advocates for a program.</p>
								<p><em>Quality assurance</em>- A collection of planned, systematic activities applied to ensure that the components of a program are being implemented well.</p>
								<p><em>Secondary data</em> – Previously collected data that is being used for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.</p>
								<p><em>Theory of behavior change</em> – An attempt to explain how and why people change their behaviors. Researchers typically generate theories of behavior change from research in the fields of psychology, education, health, and other social sciences. When developing evidence-based programs, researchers will select a theory or components from several theories to guide program development.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="glossary-right">
								<p><em>Audience</em> – The individuals for whom you implement your program. Depending on your setting, these individuals may also be referred to as a target population, population of interest, or clientele.</p>
								<p><em>Buy-in</em> – Typically used in the business world, buy-in refers to a financial exchange. In the context of health programs, the buy-in of stakeholders (community members, organizational leaders, participants, etc.) is generally non-financial. It involves their acceptance of a concept, idea, or proposal.</p>
								<p><em>Data</em> – A collection of facts, such as measurements and statistics.</p>
								<p><em>Evidence-based practice</em> – When clinicians (e.g., doctors, nurses) base their healthcare treatment decisions on the findings of current research, their clinical expertise, and the values/preferences of their patients.</p>
								<p><em>Evidence-informed practice or program</em> – A practice or program that is guided by theories and preliminary research. While there is some indication that these practices and programs produce positive outcomes, the evidence is too weak to refer to them as evidence-based. These are sometimes referred to as “promising” or “emerging” practices and programs.</p>
								<p><em>Goals</em> – General, non-measurable intentions or outcomes.</p>
								<p><em>Incentives for participation</em> – Factors that motivate an individual to take part in a program. Organizations sometimes provide incentives to encourage participants to begin and/or remain enrolled in a program. Common incentives include gift cards and program t-shirts.</p>
								<p><em>Intervention</em> – Organized efforts to promote health and prevent disease. This term is used because the efforts intervene, or come between, an individual and a negative health outcome in an attempt to prevent or delay the negative outcome. “Intervention” and “program” are often used interchangeably.</p>
								<p><em>Interventionist</em> – An individual who implements or carries out the components of a program.</p>
								<p><em>Lay leaders</em> – Individuals who do not have formal healthcare credentials who are trained to lead evidence-based programs.</p>
								<p><em>Medicare</em> – A publically-funded health insurance program for adults over age 65 and individuals with certain disabilities or health conditions.</p>
								<p><em>Partnership</em> – A cooperative relationship between two or more organizations that collaborate to achieve a common goal through the effective use of knowledge, personnel, and other resources.</p>
								<p><em>Primary data</em> – Original or new data being collected for a specific research goal.</p>
								<p><em>Protocols</em> - Predefined procedural methods. Examples include detailed program implementation procedures, required equipment, required data collection instruments with detailed instructions for administration, and recommended safety precautions.</p>
								<p><em>Readiness</em> – The degree to which an organization is prepared or ready for something.</p>
								<p><em>Stakeholder</em> – Any individual or group that has a stake or interest in a program.</p>
								<p><em>Translation</em> – The process of taking a program originally implemented in a controlled, laboratory-like setting and making it suitable for implementation in the community.</p>
